Usage:

make lessonX

(where X is numeric)
to build tutorials 1-n individually.

Use:

make all

to build all tutorials at once.

Requirements:

Mesa (I used version 3.1beta)
Requires Mesa, Mesa's version of GLUT, and 
the headers and libraries.  I used the rpms from 
http://www.rpmfind.net (Mesa 3.1beta, Mesa GLUT3.1beta, 
Mesa-devel 3.1beta, Mesa GLUT-devel 3.1beta, but you can 
get mesa directly from http://www.mesa3d.org .

X (I used version 3.3.5)
I used the rpms from http://www.rpmfind.net, but 
you can get X directly from http://www.xfree86.org .

gcc (I used egcs 2.91.66)
I used the rpms from http://www.rpmfind.net, but 
you can get egcs/gcc directly from http://egcs.cygnus.com/ .

For tutorials 14 and 15, FreeType and GLTT are required.
FreeType is a clone of Apple's TrueType fonts.  I used
the rpms from http://www.rpmfind.net, but you can get
FreeType directly from http://www.freetype.org.
GLTT is an opengl graphics library designed specifically
for 3d fonts and texture fonts.  I used the rpms from 
http://www.rpmfind.net, but you can get GLTT directly 
from http://moonlight3d.org/gltt/.

Known bugs/issues:

Non motif window managers (including fvwm95 and whatever 
gnome uses) don't honor the window hints used to request
full screen.

Some TNT cards (or possibly mesa 3.0) don't like the alpha
buffer.  The fix is to change the line:

glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_ALPHA); 

to 
glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE);   

Redhat 6.0 installs (and possibly others) use
a library called MesaGLU instead of just GLU.
To correct, change the LIBRARIES line in the 
makefile to have -lMesaGLU instead of -lGLU.

Jeff Molofee (nehe@home.com) for writing the tutorials.
Alfred (alfred@mazuma.net.au) for various fixes and improvements.
Lakmal Gunasekara (gunasekara@prostep.de) for a Solaris/SPARC
	and SGI/IRIX port, which has improved the portability
	of the code base.  Also for tutorial 8, which I only
	tweaked slightly (basically uncommented what had been
	commented out for Solaris).
